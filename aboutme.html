                <p>
                    A business analyst by day, but at heart, I‚Äôm an explorer, a storyteller, and a photographer. My journey into photography began in the most unexpected way after watching Wake Up Sid during school. Something about that movie sparked a fire within me, and before I knew it, I was walking around with my first camera, trying to capture the world as I saw it moments that could tell a thousand stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In college, my creative journey expanded. I got into designing apps, experimenting with intuitive interfaces and clean layouts, and became an active member of the photography club. Around the same time, I discovered my love for football and spent countless evenings on the field, balancing my academic and creative pursuits. However, as I transitioned into my analyst role after graduation, I had to put design on the back burner. Still, the lessons I learned‚Äîattention to detail, storytelling, and user experience stay with me and shape the way I approach everything I do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, my lens has taken me on incredible journeys across vibrant cities in India. I‚Äôve captured the chaos of streets, the serenity of cities, and the hidden stories of people. Today, I‚Äôm exploring the stunning landscapes of New Zealand, where every corner feels like it belongs on a postcard the rolling hills, pristine beaches, and dramatic mountains constantly remind me why I fell in love with photography.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Beyond my day job and photography, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by how design shapes our world. UI/UX design, in particular, intrigues me how small decisions like fonts and layouts can influence how we interact with technology. I often spend hours reading about trends, hoping to merge my analytical skills with my creative instincts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fun fact: I even designed this webpage as a way to blend my passions for design and storytelling üçª
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life through the lens has taught me one thing: beauty exists everywhere if you have the eyes to see it. Whether it‚Äôs crafting a report, designing an app, or capturing a fleeting moment of light, I‚Äôm always searching for that perfect balance between structure and story.
                </p>
